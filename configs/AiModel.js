To create the actual 30-second video, you will need video editing software and an AI image generation tool (like Midjourney, DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion) that can interpret the prompts in a realistic style.  You\'ll need to generate the images from the prompts, then combine them with narration (based on the `ContentText`) in your video editing software.  Timing each scene appropriately will be crucial to fit within the 30-second limit.  Adjusting the word count in `ContentText` will help you achieve a good pace.  Consider using a fast-paced, dramatic soundtrack to heighten the emotional impact.\n',
